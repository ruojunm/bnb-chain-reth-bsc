# Reth @ BSC

A BSC-compatible Reth client implementation. This project is **not** a fork of Reth, but rather an extension that leverages Reth's powerful `NodeBuilder` API to provide BSC compatibility.

## About

This project aims to bring Reth's high-performance Ethereum client capabilities to the BSC network. By utilizing Reth's modular architecture and NodeBuilder API, we're building a BSC-compatible client that maintains compatibility with Reth's ecosystem while adding BSC-specific features.

## Current Status

This is a **Work in Progress** project that requires community contributions to achieve the following goals:

- [ ] Historical Sync
- ✅ BSC Pectra Support
- [ ] Live Sync

### Sync Status (as of August 5, 2025)

- **BSC Mainnet**: Synced to block 47,000,000 and still syncing 🔄 (7.7TB disk usage)
- **BSC Testnet**: Synced to the tip ✅ (780GB disk usage)

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Reth documentation](https://reth.rs/) for general guidance on running a node. Note that some BSC-specific configurations may be required.

### Historical Sync

To trigger historical sync, follow these steps:

1. Build the release version:

```bash
cargo build --bin reth-bsc --release
```

2. Run the node with logging enabled:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ./target/release/reth-bsc node \
    --chain bsc \
    --debug.tip "" # set the tip to the block you want to sync to
```

## Contributing
